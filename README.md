Marionette Gentle Introduction book code guide

This repo is intented to be a guide to create a marionette application.

Marionette a Gentle Introduction is a book that I found googling around, 
I wanted to build an application fast ,scalable and highly maintainable, thats
how I ended up with Marionette along with backbone js. I'm not sure if its the 
right choice, but I'll give it a try . I'm building a financial web app for b2c, 
the application has to be fast and support 10,000.

### Interesting FACTS

I'm using
--------------

BackEnd
--------------

- Amazon EC2 ( IIS )
- Amazon RDS MySQL
- MongoHQ MongoDB
- .Net 4.5
- MVC API .net
- Amazon S3
- Nustache 
- Some PDF SDK
- Amazon SQS
- Amazon SES

FrontEnd
--------------

- Marionette.js 
- Backbone
- Underscore ( I like most mustache but marinette go along with underscore... )
-  ASP.NEt ( Not sure if It's need it ).

That's for now, this app is just the starting point of a great app that I'm trying to build.
